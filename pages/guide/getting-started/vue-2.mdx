# Tutorial of the basics

For this short tutorial, we will need the core package, as well as a theme:

```bash copy
npm install @phormal/core @phormal/theme-basic
```

We will create a form with four input fields. The **paymentMethod** radio group will be rendered with three different options. The **name** field will be a required field, and have a minimum length of 3 characters. The **email** field will also be required, and has to contain a valid email address. Lastly, there will be a checkbox for subscribing to a **newsletter**.

## Code

import Vue3 from '../../../code-examples/getting-started/vue2.mdx'

<Vue3 />

## Result

import BasicDemo from "../../../components/BasicDemo";

<BasicDemo />
