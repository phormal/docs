# Tutorial of the basics

For this short tutorial, we will need the core package, as well as some packages for theme and validation:

```bash copy
npm install @phormal/core @phormal/theme-basic @phormal/use-email @phormal/use-required @phormal/use-length
```

We will create a form with three input fields. The **name** field will be a required field, and have a minimum length of 3 characters. The **email** field will also be required, and has to contain a valid email address. Lastly, there will be a checkbox for subscribing to a **newsletter**.

## Step 1: JavaScript

import Vanilla from '../../../code-examples/getting-started/vanilla.mdx'

<Vanilla />

## Step 2: HTML

In `formConfig`, we have specified the element, `el`, where the form should be rendered. Your HTML needs an element with the id `phormal`.

## Step 3: CSS

The stylesheet for the basic theme is included in the `@phormal/theme-basic` package. You can import it such as:

```
@import '@phormal/theme-basic/dist/index.css'
```

## Result

import BasicDemo from "../../../components/BasicDemo";

<BasicDemo />
