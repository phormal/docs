## Library of packages

Phormal is library of a few packages. At the least, you will need to install the core package:

```bash copy
npm install @phormal/core
```

This one contains the code for rendering form fields of different types, logic for validating them, and translations for displaying error messages in different languages. Though only 11 languages are supported right now, it is our goal to provide translations for as many languages as possible (mainly for error messages).

The validators and translations, however, are all tree-shakeable, meaning you will only end up with roughly as much bundled code as you need.

If you want to style the form yourself, you will not have to download anything else. For using out built in themes, however, move on to [Getting started](/guide/getting-started/vanilla).
