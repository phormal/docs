# Validating form input

For validating data, Phormal uses a concept called **hooks**. Instead of making a field required with `required: true`, or giving it a minimum- and maximum length through for example `{ minLength: 3, maxLength: 10 }`, we install hooks. This might seem verbose at first, but of course has its reasons:

1. This way, we keep the logic for detecting errors in the input, and their translations into different languages, together in one place.
2. By only adding the translations through adding a hook, we can keep bundle sizes smaller. The multitude of translations of a hook never end up in your bundled code, unless you explicitly use the hook.

An example of hooks usage:

```js
import {Phormal, useEmail, useLength, useRequired} from "@phormal/core";

new Phormal(
  {
    name: {
      label: 'Name',
      hooks: [useRequired(), useLength(3)]
    },
    email: {
      label: 'Email',
      hooks: [useRequired(), useEmail()]
    }
  },
  {
    // ... other config
    language: 'es'
  }
)
```

would give you the following form. Try typing a little, and maybe deleting your own input, to see the spanish translations of the error messages.

import DemoWithSpanish from "../../components/DemoWithSpanish";

<DemoWithSpanish />
