# Themes

There are currently two available themes for the library. Both themes come with built-in:

* Responsiveness to different screen sizes and root font sizes
* Left-to-right and right-to-left support
* Dark and light color schemes

## Installation
```bash copy
npm install @phormal/theme-basic
```

or

```bash copy
npm install @phormal/theme-material
```

Examples of how they look can be found on the examples page:
* [Basic](/examples)
* [Material](/examples?theme=material).

## Importing

import {Tabs, Tab} from 'nextra-theme-docs';

<Tabs items={['basic', 'material']}>
	<Tab>
		```js copy
		@import '@phormal/theme-basic/dist/index.css';
		```
	</Tab>

	<Tab>
		```js copy
		@import '@phormal/theme-material/dist/index.css';
		```
	</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

If you're using the `basic` theme, you do not need to configure anything, since this is the default. For using the `material` theme, please enter the following into your configuration object:

```js
const config = {
  // .. other config
  theme: 'material'
}
```

For more on configuration of the form, please refer to the [configuration section](/usage#config).

## Dark mode

Dark mode ships per default with both themes. It is activated in one of two ways:

1. through the `color-scheme`-attribute on a parent element of the form (in most cases this would be the `<html>`-Tag). For example:

```html
<html style="color-scheme: dark;"></html>
```

2. through user system settings.

If the user's system setting and the `color-scheme` attribute are conflicting, the latter will have precedence, in order to allow full control for the website maintainer.
