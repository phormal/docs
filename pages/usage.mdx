## The Phormal instance

The Phormal instance is the main class of the library. An instance of Phormal is initialized through the `Phormal` constructor. It takes two arguments:

* [`fields`](#fields), which is an object containing configuration for the fields of the form.
* [`config`](#config), which is an object containing configuration for the form itself.

If you're using a framework adapter like the React adapter, the `fields` and `config` arguments are simply passed to the `useForm` function.

For example:

```js copy
import {Phormal} from "@phormal/core";

const fields = {/** see #fields section below */}, config = {/** see #config section below */};

new Phormal(fields, config);
```

### `fields`

The `fields` argument is an object containing configuration for the fields of the form. The keys of the object are the names of the fields, and the values are the configuration for each field. If we want to create a basic form with two fields, `name` and `email`, the fields argument could look like this:

```js copy
const fields = {
    name: {
        label: "Name"
    },
    birthdate: {
        label: "Email",
        placeholder: "john.doe@example.com"
    },
    newsletter: {
        label: "Subscribe to newsletter",
        type: "checkbox",
        value: false
    }
};
```

The configuration for each field can take the following properties:

|                                 Property                                  |                                                              Type/Possible values                                                              |     Default     |

|                                  `label`                                  |                                                                     string                                                                     |      `''`       |
| `placeholder` (has no effect in material theme; label acts a placeholder) |                                                                     string                                                                     |      `''`       |
|                                  `value`                                  |                                               string (for most types) or boolean (for checkbox)                                                | `''` or `false` |
|                                `disabled`                                 |                                                                    boolean                                                                     |     `false`     |
|                               `disabledIf`                                |                                                   See [field conditions](#field-conditions)                                                    |   `undefined`   |
|                                 `hideIf`                                  |                                                   See [field conditions](#field-conditions)                                                    |   `undefined`   |
|                                   `row`                                   | Combine several fields visually into a flex row, by giving them the property `row` and assigning them a common **string** value of your choice |   `undefined`   |
|            `options` (only for **radiogroup** and **select**)             |                                         Array of options with type `{ label: string, value: string }`                                          |      `[]`       |
|                                  `hooks`                                  |                                                       Array of returned [hooks](/hooks)                                                        |                 |
|          `min` (only for date, datetime-local, and time inputs)           |                                See [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/min)                                |                 |
|          `max` (only for date, datetime-local, and time inputs)           |                                See [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/max)                                |                 |

In some cases, you might need to react to the native events of a field. This is possible through the properties `handleOnClick`, `handleOnInput`, `handleOnChange`, `handleOnFocus` and `handleOnBlur`. These properties take the shape of a function, where the first argument is the event itself. For example:

```js copy
new Phormal(
  {
    lastName: {
      label: 'Last name',
      handleOnFocus: (event, field) => {
        console.log(event.target.value); // the value of the field
      }
    }
  },
  { /** form config */ }
)
```

In some even more rare cases, you might want to access the internal APIs of a field. Therefore, the above-mentioned event handlers pass the field as the second argument. For available methods on the `field` object, see [FormFieldInterface](https://github.com/phormal/phormal/blob/master/packages/core/src/types/interfaces/FormField.interface.ts).

#### Field conditions

Some properties of a form field can be set conditionally, depending on the value of other fields. If, for example, you have a field named **email**, but you only want to display it if the checkbox **newsletter** is checked, this can be achieved the following way:

```js copy
const fields = {
  newsletter: {
    type: 'checkbox',
    label: 'Subscribe to newsletter'
  },
  email: {
    label: 'Email',
    hideIf: {
      newsletter: false
    }
  }
}
```

A field condition always consists of key-value pairs, where the key is the name of the field that your field should depend on, and the value is the condition. In this case the condition was a `boolean`. Accepted values of the condition are:

|      Condition       |                                        Purpose                                        |
|:--------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|       `empty`        |                Check if the value of targeted field is an empty string                |
|     `not-empty`      |          Check if the value of targeted field is a string with a length > 0           |
| RegEx, e.g. `/^US$/` |                                     Test a regex                                      |
|       boolean        | Conditionally do something, based on whether a field has the values `true` or `false` |




### `config`

The second parameter of the `Phormal` constructor is the form configuration. These are its available properties:

|      Property      |  type  |                                                                                     Purpose                                                                                      | required | Default  |
|:------------------:|:------:|:--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:--------:|:--------:|
|        `el`        | string |                                                               Selector of HTML element on which to mount the form                                                                |   yes    |    -     |
|      `theme`       | string |                                                                                  Name of theme                                                                                   |    no    | `basic`  |
|     `language`     | string | Set the language in which error messages should be shown, for example `'us'` or `'de'`. Should be of [ISO 639-1 standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) |    no    |   `en`   |
| `fallbackLanguage` | string | If you dynamically set the language for the form, and the possibility remains, that this language is not yet supported by this library, you will want to set a fallback language |    no    |   `en`   |
|    `validation`    | string |                                    `active` for automatic validation of form, on all user-input. `passive` for disabling automatic validation                                    |    no    | `active` |

### Methods

#### `$values()`

Returns an object with key-value pairs, where each key is the name of the fields you specified, and the values are the values of those fields.

#### `$validate()`

Runs all validators for all fields. Returns `true` if the values of all fields are valid, and `false` otherwise.

#### `$reset()`

If called with no arguments, this method resets all fields to their initial values. You can also specify the name of your different fields as arguments to the method. This will then only reset the specified fields. For example:

```js copy
const phormal = new Phormal({
  name: {
    label: 'Name'
  },
  email: {
    label: 'Email'
  },
  password: {
    label: 'Password'
  }
})

phormal.$reset('email', 'password') // resets only the fields 'email' and 'password'
```

### Properties

#### `$isDirty`

Returns `true` if the value of any field has been changed since initializing the form, and `false` otherwise.


#### `$errors`

Returns an object with key-value pairs, where the key refers to the name of the field, and the value is an array of errors that currently apply to the field.
